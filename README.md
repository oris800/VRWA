# RetroStore: A Multi-Stage Web Security CTF

Welcome to RetroStore, a fully functional e-commerce web application.
I built this project from the ground up to implement and demonstrate a wide variety of security vulnerabilities in a realistic environment. This isn't just a collection of bugs, but a complete offensive campaign.

## 🎯 The Mission

Your goal is to chain together **8 distinct security vulnerabilities** to achieve a full system takeover (Reverse Shell) and read the final flag located at `/root/flag.txt`.

The application includes the following features:
* User registration and login system.
* External and internal password reset mechanism.
* Product review and comment system.
* A complete shopping cart and checkout system.
